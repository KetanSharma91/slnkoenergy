                        <p>The module market is going through turmoil, and prices are changing daily. There is a huge
                            gap in demand and supply, resulting in a crisis like situation. There have been multiple
                            factors affecting this market over the months, which can be summarised as below:</p>

                        <p>COVID-19:</p>

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has now spread its black shadow worldwide, influencing almost every
                            market sector, including the solar module industry, one of the fastest-growing sectors.
                            Manufacturing and logistics which have slowed the module industry&rsquo;s growth, are
                            undeniably the primary industries withering due to coronavirus (COVID-19). According to
                            industry analysts, one out of every five top manufacturing solar module firms relies on the
                            Chinese market to supply products and materials. However, all manufacturing sectors are in a
                            state like that of the 2008 crisis, with China factories still closed and travel facilities
                            banned worldwide. Chinese vendors who have also dominated the market for modules since
                            2018,&nbsp; the leading five suppliers accounted for 60% of global cellular module shipments
                            and revenue captured is 71% of the market. Their failure to export modules to different
                            parts of the world has exacerbated the situation.</p>

                        <p>And since this pandemic has hit almost all countries, finding alternative routes has also
                            become nearly impossible. It is Something that is highlighting that the coronavirus effect
                            on the module industry is dreadful.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Shortage of PV module Raw material:</p>

                        <p>In July 2020, reports emerged of a series of flash explosions at a GCL-Poly Energy owned
                            plant in north-western region Xinjiang experiencing an output disruption taking down more
                            than 10% of the&nbsp;<a
                                href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/03/30/covid-19-and-dependence-on-chinas-pv-supply-chain/">global
                                supply</a>&nbsp;of the solar power raw material out of
                            production&nbsp;<em>(Source:</em>&nbsp;www.pv-magazine.com<em>&nbsp;)</em></p>

                        <p>Polysilicon prices have increased more than 60% afterwards. This caused a huge disruption in
                            the module market. Solar module prices remained unstable due to the interplay of several
                            factors exacerbated by these&nbsp;<a
                                href="https://mercomindia.com/gcl-poly-warns-shareholders-huge-losses-in-1h-2020/">explosions</a>&nbsp;in
                            China&rsquo;s leading polysilicon manufacturing units.</p>

                        <p>The solar industry had an unusual year in 2020. Module prices started increasing in mid-2020
                            because of a supply disruption caused by floods in China&rsquo;s southeast province. Tongwei
                            Group, a Chinese feedstock and solar raw material supplier, was forced to shut down a
                            quarter of its polycrystalline silicon capacity due to this unusually severe flood. This has
                            altogether hit supplies across the globe. Even after some time, prices stabilized after a
                            while, but they started increasing again in the last quarter of 2020. This is because of the
                            bottleneck in adequate glass-processing capacity caused due to several unexpected turmoils
                            in manufacturing, logistics, and the supply chain of solar module, hampering supply and
                            drove up prices in a short period. Furthermore, there are shortages of glass, EVA, and other
                            products, resulting in a price increase. It has been anticipated a lack of solar modules and
                            materials supplies throughout the world.</p>

                        <p>Freight rates hike:</p>

                        <p>Besides raw materials, freight rates have shot up 5-8 times due to a shortage of shipping
                            containers. Rising consumer demand and constrained supply of containers is disrupting the
                            seas. Moreover, several importers postponed their plans due to the pandemic, resulting in a
                            drop in orders from Chinese suppliers during the summer. As a result, the second and third
                            quarters of 2020 also resulted in a 5-15 per cent drop in transhipments in European ports.
                            In response, the shipping cost is increasing rapidly, mainly exporting from China. For
                            example, some of the latest reports showed spot freight rate from Asia to northern Europe
                            increased by 3% over the previous week, 145% over the beginning of this year.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Solar Modules and Indian market:</p>

                        <p>India&rsquo;s solar manufacturing lags the major global players, notwithstanding being one of
                            the largest markets for solar applications in terms of size and technology. Moreover, even
                            though the Indian government encourages local solar manufacturing, investment activity is
                            still limited. As a result, imported modules are perhaps the most bankable when it comes to
                            considerations for module bankability, whether it is quality, brand, or price.</p>

                        <p>According to an article written in the energy world, the cumulative amount of the
                            country&rsquo;s solar imports in FY17, FY18, and FY19 were $3,196.5 million, $3,837.6
                            million, and $2,159.7 million, respectively. Around 85% of solar cells and modules are
                            supplied by Chinese companies to India.</p>

                        <p>Manufacturers of solar power generation equipment in India face a problematic situation due
                            to high import duties on raw materials and the high cost of shipping, making it impossible
                            to increase manufacturing in the region. Moreover, with such a large percentage of
                            India&rsquo;s solar panels and modules imported from China, an increase in prices has
                            worried developers.&nbsp;The debate over whether to build tariff walls to allow
                            India&rsquo;s manufacturing industry to grow behind them, or to enable Indian solar energy
                            companies to profit from low-cost imports of modules, has raged for years.</p>

                        <p>This year, on another side, has also seen a renewed drive for domestic manufacturing in
                            India&rsquo;s solar industry to reduce the country&rsquo;s reliance on imports. However, the
                            COVID-19 disrupting global supply chains created a severe market shock, according to Du
                            &amp; Bradstreet, which has offset the Indian economy&rsquo;s positive signs of growth that
                            were apparent towards early 2021, affecting the module market. And, while there was an
                            attempt to weather the impact of the first covid wave with the assistance of emergency cost
                            cuts, the advent of the second wave has forced the Indian manufacturers to tighten their
                            belts even further.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The impending crisis has undoubtedly emerged as a wake-up call for the solar PV sector,
                            emphasizing our dependence on &ldquo;imports.&rdquo; Therefore, our government has high time
                            to bring practical proposals to construct new made-in-India manufacturing facilities for PV
                            modules and energy storage. This will not only alleviate reliance on imports but will also
                            result in the creation of jobs.</p>
